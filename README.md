# üß≠ Travel AI Assistant

A modular, agent-powered travel planner built with LangGraph and LangChain, integrating real-time APIs (OpenWeatherMap) and prompt engineering strategies to deliver personalized trip plans.

---

## üåç Overview

This project simulates a next-generation AI-assisted travel guide. It enables tourists to dynamically plan and adjust their itineraries based on preferences like weather, budget, route type, and cultural points of interest. Built as part of a technical assessment, the solution focuses on:

* ‚úÖ Multi-agent collaboration
* ‚úÖ Prompt engineering strategies
* ‚úÖ Real-time API integration
* ‚úÖ Modular, testable code

---

## üß† Architecture

### üß© Agent Design (LangGraph MCP-style)

* **Planner Agent**: builds an initial itinerary based on the user's origin, destination, and preferences.
* **Optimizer Agent**: adjusts the itinerary considering constraints such as cost, weather, or duration.
* **Reporter Agent**: generates a friendly final summary in natural language using an LLM.

All agents are orchestrated using LangGraph's `StateGraph`, enabling clear state propagation and flow control.

## üìù Prompt Strategy

System prompts play a crucial role in shaping agent behavior. This project includes three prompt variants tailored to common travel goals:

### 1. `scenic.txt`

**Tone**: Descriptive, enriching
**Goal**: Maximize cultural, natural, and historical exposure
**Use case**: Ideal for users who want slow, inspiring travel experiences

> "You are a thoughtful travel planner focused on crafting scenic journeys. Include stops at natural landscapes, historic towns, and cultural landmarks. Avoid highways and prioritize memorable routes."

### 2. `fastest.txt`

**Tone**: Direct, pragmatic
**Goal**: Optimize travel speed and efficiency
**Use case**: Ideal for business travelers or users on tight schedules

> "You are a highly efficient travel planner. Your goal is to minimize travel time while ensuring essential details like directions and weather are accurate. Focus on highways and direct routes."

### 3. `weather.txt`

**Tone**: Balanced, cautious
**Goal**: Maximize safety and comfort by avoiding bad weather
**Use case**: Ideal for family travel or travel during volatile seasons

> "You are a travel planner that optimizes routes for weather safety. Suggest routes that avoid rain, storms, or extreme temperatures. Prioritize stops with good weather over scenic appeal."

### üß† Rationale

These prompts vary across three dimensions:

* **Tone** (warm vs. efficient)
* **Goal** (scenic vs. fast vs. safe)
* **Constraints** (avoid bad weather, prioritize comfort or cultural depth)

This allows us to:

* Test **response quality and tone adaptability**
* Evaluate how well different prompts satisfy **user intent**
* Support future **multi-turn adaptation**

Prompt loading is dynamic based on the user's trip type (selected via input).

## üîå API Integrations

* **OpenWeatherMap API**: for real-time weather summaries at each stop.
* **Mocked POI and Routing APIs**: simulate cultural sites and path generation with location-specific logic (Europe vs Mexico).

## üß™ Evaluation Logic *(in progress)*

A modular script will:

1. Run the graph with each prompt.
2. Score based on:

   * Itinerary structure (start, stops, destination)
   * Constraint match (weather, cost, duration)
   * LLM-based critique on tone & helpfulness

---

## ‚úÖ Testing Plan *(in progress)*

* Unit tests for each agent (`planner`, `optimizer`, `reporter`)
* Mocked API test cases
* Prompt-based behavior comparison tests

## üôå Notes

This was completed under a strict time constraint. The solution reflects scalable thinking, modular structure, and production-oriented architecture despite being a prototype.
